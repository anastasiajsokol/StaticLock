# Static Lock Toolchain

## Development Tools

The development command line tool is named `staticlock` and serves to make it easy for you to secure directories before deploying your static site.

    WARNING: unlocked raw directories should not be uploaded to the site if they should be 'locked', make sure that you only upload the corresponding locked directory

## Library

The Static Lock library should be hosted on your site. This consists of a javascript module which will need to be used on any page that manages permissions and a service worker which will be setup by the module when its use becomes necessary for your application. You will also need to upload a json map of your encrypted directories into the base directory, this is auto generated by the `staticlock` tool and will be used by both the library and the service worker to verify passwords and know where to look for encrypted files. Note that this json map will leak the names of your encrypted directories (ie if you setup an encrypted directory /movies then a user could use the json map to know that there is a directory named /movies, depending on what information your server gives it may also be possible to know how many files are in a given directory and get a general idea of how big each file is, however the raw names of these files will not be made public - unless if you leak it yourself in an unencrypted directory).
